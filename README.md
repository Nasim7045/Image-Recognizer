Image Recognizer Project
This project is an Image Recognizer that uses the BLIP-2 model (or BLIP model) to generate descriptive captions for images. It leverages state-of-the-art deep learning models from Hugging Face's transformers library to analyze and describe images in natural language.

Features
Image Captioning: Generates human-readable descriptions for any input image.

BLIP-2 Model: Utilizes the powerful BLIP-2 model for accurate and detailed image understanding.

GPU Support: Automatically detects and uses GPU for faster processing (if available).

Easy to Use: Simple Python script with clear instructions for setup and usage.

Installation
Prerequisites
Python 3.8 or higher

pip (Python package manager)

Steps
Clone this repository:

bash
Copy
git clone https://github.com/your-username/image-recognizer.git
cd image-recognizer
Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

bash
Copy
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
Install the required dependencies:

bash
Copy
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Place the image you want to analyze in the project directory or provide the full path to the image.

Run the script:

bash
Copy
python image_recognizer.py --image_path path/to/your/image.jpg
Example:

bash
Copy
python image_recognizer.py --image_path example.jpg
The script will output a description of the image, such as:

Copy
Image Description: A group of people standing on a beach watching the sunset.
Configuration
Model Selection
By default, the script uses the BLIP-2 model (Salesforce/blip2-opt-2.7b). You can switch to a smaller model (e.g., Salesforce/blip-image-captioning-base) by modifying the describe_image function in the script.

Device
The script automatically uses a GPU if available. To force CPU usage, modify the device variable in the script:

python
Copy
device = "cpu"
Example
Input Image
Example Image

Output
Copy
Image Description: A cat sitting on a windowsill looking outside.
Dependencies
Python 3.8+

torch (PyTorch)

transformers (Hugging Face)

Pillow (Image processing)

Install all dependencies using:

bash
Copy
pip install torch transformers Pillow
